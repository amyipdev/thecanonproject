# The Constitution of the United States of America

## Preamble

The People of these United States of America, in order to form a strong and independent Union, provide for the protection and needs of its Residents, and defend the freedom of all, keeping in mind the previous actions of governments across Turtle Island and the failure to honor the rights of its indigenous peoples, hereby establish this Constitution of the United States of America. 

## ARTICLE I. The Branches of Government.

### Section 1. General Provisions.

1. No national public official who is elected or otherwise serves as an administrator of one of the branches of the national Government shall serve while under the age of sixteen or after having attained the age of sixty-five. This clause does not apply to state and local officials.
2. Unless otherwise specified, no public official shall serve without attaining a score of at least 80 percent on the National Civil Service Examination, as defined in this Constitution.
3. For the purposes of this article, and elsewhere in this Constitution unless otherwise specified, years shall be based on the Gregorian calendar.
4. No public official shall be compensated at a rate more than one and one-half times the median income of residents of this Nation.

### Section 2. The Legislative Branch.

1. All national legislative powers, except those delegated by this Constitution or by the Congress itself to another agency, shall be granted to the Congress of the United States of America, a unicameral body composed of representatives from the States.
2. All statutes of the Congress must be implemented through changes to the titles of, or the creation of a new title of, the United States Code. No national statute (except for treaties and the Uniform State Laws) shall have any effect unless duly entered into the United States Code.
3. The Congress shall have the exclusive authority to declare offensive war and authorize the use of military force. These declarations and authorizations must be made with a three-fourths affirmative vote of present members of Congress, with two-thirds of members being present during the vote. Such shall not take effect until a Special Election can be held, in which three-fifths of the population must vote in the affirmative for the authorization or declaration to be valid. No authorization of the use of military force for offensive purposes shall last more than two years. This clause does not apply to bona fide defensive actions in response to attacks from foreign nations. 
4. The Districts for Representatives to be elected to Congress shall be drawn proportionally, with the total number of Districts being determined by Congress; however, no District may represent more than 500,000 residents. The apportionment of Districts shall be performed in a neutral manner, such as to not intentionally advantage a particular candidate, party, or demographic group.
5. Terms of Representatives shall last two years, with regular terms commencing on January 3 in even-numbered years.
6. No Representative shall serve for more than five terms.
7. The Legislative Branch shall have sole budgetary authority over the national Government. No budget may be passed which places the Government into a deficit, unless the amount of the deficit is comprised solely of self-borrowing measures that, upon resolution, would leave the budget balanced. This clause does not apply to the budget of the Social Welfare Division, which must be jointly approved by the Congress and the Social Welfare Division.

## ARTICLE II. Citizenship, Voting, Nationality, and Residency.

### Section 1. Voting and Elections.

1. No person who is denied the right to vote in an election shall be required to pay taxes to the jurisdiction which denies them the right to vote. If a jurisdiction does not assess taxes upon its voters, it shall receive a deduction on assigned resources proportional to the percentage of individuals in the jurisdiction who lack the right to vote in elections of that jurisdiction. This clause does not apply to jurisdictions with no elected offices.
2. There shall be no primary elections prior to the General Election for a given office. All votes shall be recorded using ranked-choice voting. A runoff election may only be scheduled if no candidate receives a majority of votes at the conclusion of the ranked choice elimination process.
3. Special Elections may be called from time to time pursuant to this Constitution, to fill a newly created office, or to replace an elected official who has been removed from or who has left their position.
4. Once per year, a National Survey shall be conducted in which all offices for which an individual is eligible to vote are placed on the ballot. For each official, a voter shall list "keep", "remove", or "abstain". If, with abstentions included in the total number of votes, "remove" receives a majority of votes, the official shall be immediately removed and a Special Election called to replace them. The National Survey shall only include candidates whose elections are not in the year of the survey. It shall be open for voting beginning on the first Tuesday of October, with voting concluding on the third Tuesday of October. The National Survey shall also include all judges and justices, regardless of whether they are elected; the managers of public financial institutions; and the second-in-commands for every elected office, should such a position exist.
5. All elections shall be national, state, local, and employer holidays. The deadline for a National Survey submission is not such a holiday, unless it coincides with other elections.
6. Ballots shall, in all elections at all levels (including the National Survey), be accepted by mail, in addition to any other secure formats used by a jurisdiction's electoral authority.
7. No one who is eligible to vote shall be denied the right to register to vote, or have any impedances places on such registration. The Executive Branch shall take reasonable measures to promote voter registration.
