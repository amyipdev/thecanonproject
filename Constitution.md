# The Constitution of the United States of America

## Preamble

The People of these United States of America, in order to form a strong and independent Union, provide for the protection and needs of its Residents, and defend the freedom of all, keeping in mind the previous actions of governments across Turtle Island and the failure to honor the rights of its indigenous peoples, hereby establish this Constitution of the United States of America. 

## ARTICLE I. The Branches of Government.

### Section 1. General Provisions.

1. No national public official who is elected or otherwise serves as an administrator of one of the branches of the national Government shall serve while under the age of sixteen or after having attained the age of sixty-five. This clause does not apply to state and local officials.
2. Unless otherwise specified, no public official shall serve without attaining a score of at least 80 percent on the National Civil Service Examination, as defined in this Constitution.
3. For the purposes of this article, and elsewhere in this Constitution unless otherwise specified, years shall be based on the Gregorian calendar.
4. No public official shall be compensated at a rate more than one and one-half times the median income of residents of this Nation. The relative rate of compensation for a given elected position shall not increase until that position comes up for election again.

### Section 2. The Legislative Branch.

1. All national legislative powers, except those delegated by this Constitution or by the Congress itself to another agency, shall be granted to the Congress of the United States of America, a unicameral body composed of representatives from the States.
2. All statutes of the Congress must be implemented through changes to the titles of, or the creation of a new title of, the United States Code. No national statute (except for treaties and the Uniform State Laws) shall have any effect unless duly entered into the United States Code.
3. The Congress shall have the exclusive authority to declare offensive war and authorize the use of military force. These declarations and authorizations must be made with a three-fourths affirmative vote of present members of Congress, with two-thirds of members being present during the vote. Such shall not take effect until a Special Election can be held, in which three-fifths of the population must vote in the affirmative for the authorization or declaration to be valid. No authorization of the use of military force for offensive purposes shall last more than two years. This clause does not apply to bona fide defensive actions in response to attacks from foreign nations. 
4. The Districts for Representatives to be elected to Congress shall be drawn proportionally, with the total number of Districts being determined by Congress; however, no District may represent more than 500,000 residents. The apportionment of Districts shall be performed in a neutral manner, such as to not intentionally advantage a particular candidate, party, or demographic group.
5. Terms of Representatives shall last two years, with regular terms commencing on January 3 in even-numbered years.
6. No Representative shall serve for more than five terms.
7. The Legislative Branch shall have sole budgetary authority over the national Government. No budget may be passed which places the Government into a deficit, unless the amount of the deficit is comprised solely of self-borrowing measures that, upon resolution, would leave the budget balanced. This clause does not apply to the budget of the Social Welfare Division, which must be jointly approved by the Congress and the Social Welfare Division.

### Section 3. The Judicial Branch.

1. The Legislative Branch shall have the power to establish national Courts, pursuant to the terms of this section.
2. The Supreme Court of the United States shall be vested with thirteen Justices, one of whom is the presiding Chief Justice.
    1. Justices shall be appointed by the President for terms of five years, and no Justice shall serve more than two terms.
    2. Justices must have doctorates in constitutional law, as determined by the Executive Branch, or twenty years of legal experience, and must score at least 90 percent on the National Civil Service Exam. 
    3. The Supreme Court shall be the highest Court, with final appellate jurisdiction over all cases in the national and state courts. Cases shall be heard at the Supreme Court by eight of the thirteen Justices issuing a joint sua sponte writ of certioari on a case from a state Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal, or by five of the thirteen Justices signing a petition for a writ of certiorari; this writ petition must have been filed within 120 days of the judgement being appealed, and the signatures must be issued within a year of filing.
    5. The Supreme Court shall hear all cases, and shall have exclusive jurisdiction over cases, where:
        1. Both of the parties are states;
        2. Both of the parties are Branches;
        3. One party is a component of the national Government, and the other is a state; or
        4. One party is the Government, whether in a criminal or civil case, and the other is an official representative of a foreign state.
3. The Courts of Appeal shall be established for Circuits, as the Legislative Branch shall determine the boundaries of.
    1. The Courts of Appeal shall have appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising from a national Court that is not a Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.
    2. Parties in cases in national courts for which the Court of Appeal has appellate jurisdiction shall have the right to appeal, except for the prosecutors in a criminal case; the Court shall not refuse to hear such an appeal.
    3. Appeals for all cases, except for appeals in cases where a felony conviction has occurred, shall be initially heard by a three-judge panel. Should the judgement of the panel be unfavorable to the party appealed against, they may file a petition for the case to be heard by all judges of the Court. Felony appeals shall be automatically heard by all judges of the Court.
    4. Judges in the Court of Appeal shall be appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice to terms of seven years. No judge shall serve more than three terms.
    5. The Judges in each Court of Appeal shall annually elect a Presiding Judge, who shall draft the procedures for the Court and for all District Courts in the Court's circuit.
    6. Judges in the Court of Appeal must have at least ten years of legal experience, or a doctorate in constitutional law.
4. The District Courts shall be established within the boundaries of the circuits of the Courts of Appeal, and shall be the default court for all cases where Congress has not established another court and which concern a national question (including causes of action derived from all national laws, or the violation of a national law, or cases concerning this Constitution) or in which the parties are from different states.
    1. District Court boundaries shall not cross the boundaries of states; however, states may have more than one District Court.
    2. A District Court shall be comprised of at least one Division, with each Divsion being present at a physical courthouse.
    3. District Court judges must have at least five years of legal experience, or a master's in constitutional law.
    4. Judges for District Courts shall be appointed by the Presiding Judge for the Court's circuit. No District Court shall have less than three judges. Judges shall be assigned at random to cases, with reassignments also being random.
6. Where applicable, the United States accepts the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court. The provisions of treaties establishing these Courts shall be considered to comply with this Constitution.
7. All national Justices and Judges shall be listed on the National Survey. Judges shall only be listed in the jurisdictions covered by their Court.

## ARTICLE II. Citizenship, Nationality, and Voting.

### Section 1. Voting and Elections.

1. No person who is denied the right to vote in an election shall be required to pay taxes to the jurisdiction which denies them the right to vote. If a jurisdiction does not assess taxes upon its voters, it shall receive a deduction on assigned resources proportional to the percentage of individuals in the jurisdiction who lack the right to vote in elections of that jurisdiction. This clause does not apply to jurisdictions with no elected offices.
2. There shall be no primary elections prior to the General Election for a given office. All votes shall be recorded using ranked-choice voting. A runoff election may only be scheduled if no candidate receives a majority of votes at the conclusion of the ranked choice elimination process.
3. Special Elections may be called from time to time pursuant to this Constitution, to fill a newly created office, or to replace an elected official who has been removed from or who has left their position.
4. Once per year, a National Survey shall be conducted in which all offices for which an individual is eligible to vote are placed on the ballot. For each official, a voter shall list "keep", "remove", or "abstain". If, with abstentions included in the total number of votes, "remove" receives a majority of votes, the official shall be immediately removed and a Special Election called to replace them. The National Survey shall only include candidates whose elections are not in the year of the survey. It shall be open for voting beginning on the first Tuesday of October, with voting concluding on the third Tuesday of October. The National Survey shall also include all judges and justices, regardless of whether they are elected; the managers of public financial institutions; and the second-in-commands for every elected office, should such a position exist.
5. All elections shall be national, state, local, and employer holidays. The deadline for a National Survey submission is not such a holiday, unless it coincides with other elections.
6. Ballots shall, in all elections at all levels (including the National Survey), be accepted by mail, in addition to any other secure formats used by a jurisdiction's electoral authority.
7. No one who is eligible to vote shall be denied the right to register to vote, or have any impedances places on such registration. The Executive Branch shall take reasonable measures to promote voter registration, including automatic registration.
8. Those under incarceration for a misdemeanor charge shall retain the right to vote in all of their eligible jurisdictions while incarcerated. Those convicted of a felony charge shall be able to vote in all of their eligible jurisdictions upon release.
9. Non-citizens who have resided in a given jurisdiction for a year shall not be denied the right to vote on the basis of citizenship or nationality.
10. No person at or over the age of sixteen shall be denied the right to vote on the basis of age. The national government and individual jurisdictions may create equitable and unbiased tests for granting voting rights to those under sixteen.

### Section 2. Citizenship and Nationality.

1. All those who are born in the United States, or who have at least one parent who is a citizen or national of the United States in active residence, shall automatically be citizens. 
2. Those who hold the status of a national and have continuous residence in the United States for seven years shall be allowed to, at no cost, petition for citizenship. No petition for citizenship which is complete, correct, and truthful shall be denied.
3. Congress shall establish regulations for the adoption of national status, with such regulations at minimum providing a general right to national status after three years of continuous legal presence. No such regulation shall be discriminatory on the basis of immutable characteristics, including but not limited to race, color, sex, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, or caste; or discriminate on the basis of religion.
4. Citizenship may never be revoked by the government. National status may only be revoked upon conviction, and after the exhaustion of appeals or waiver (whether explicit or implied by time), of a felony involving physical violence against another person, or of treason.
5. The right to give up citizenship or nationality shall never be abridged, and must be made available at no cost.
6. No one shall be ejected from the United States solely because they entered illegally. The Executive Branch shall provide a simple, free, and safe process for those without legal presence to gain legal presence.
7. Citizens and nationals shall have the right to hold and attain other citizenships and nationalities. Renunciation of foreign citizenships and nationalities shall not be a requirement for attaining United States citizenship or nationality.
